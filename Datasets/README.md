# Datasets details
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct a comparative study on synthetic and public datasets, encompassing 193 datasets. 


## Synthetic Datasets
Following our previous work~\cite{sun2024shrink, sun2025highly}, we firstly used the **UcNe collection** data collection include nine public datasets without ground truth. Five of them are derived from the UCR time series repository and four from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). We introduce synthetic outliers in these datasets for systematic evaluation. Point outliers are randomly introduced by selecting 0.1\% of time points and perturbing their values by adding or subtracting four times the standard deviation of the original signal. Sequence outliers are randomly introduced by non-overlapping segments with lengths drawn uniformly from the range 10–30 time steps. The total number of outlier points from sequence outliers accounts for 1.0\% of the data length. This procedure follows common practices adopted in synthetic benchmark construction for time series anomaly detection~\cite{blazquez2021review, wenig2022timeeval}, and aims to emulate sensor faults and abrupt behavioral changes frequently encountered in IoT systems. 
Following our previous work [[1]](#1), the **UcNe collection** includes nine public datasets without ground truth:
- 5 datasets from the UCR time series repository  
- 4 datasets from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)

We inject synthetic anomalies following standard practices [[2],[3]]:
- **Point outliers**: randomly inject 0.1% of time points by adding/subtracting four times the standard deviation.  
- **Sequence outliers**: inject non-overlapping segments (length 10–30 time steps), accounting for ~1.0% of total points.  

This procedure emulates sensor faults and abrupt behavioral changes commonly encountered in IoT systems.  

## Public Datasets with Ground Truth

- **SED** [[4]](#4): This dataset is generated by simulating the behaviour of spinning disks in NASA’s Rotor Dynamics Laboratory. It exhibits quasi-periodic patterns with subtle deviations, providing a controlled environment for evaluating sensitivity to small-scale anomalies.  
- **Genesis** [[5]](#5):  Captured from an industrial pick-and-place demonstrator equipped with pneumatic actuators. The signals reflect the dynamic behaviour of air pressure and control states, making the dataset representative of real-world mechatronic systems. 
- **ECG** [[6]](#6): Constructed from a long ambulatory ECG recording (MBAECG14046), this dataset has been segmented into multiple series based on signal periodicity. Anomalies typically represent premature ventricular contractions. 
- **MGAB** [[7]](#7):This dataset was based on Mackey-Glass equations, exhibiting complex and nonlinear chaotic behaviour. It is frequently used to evaluate the capacity of models to distinguish between noise and true anomalies.
- **SensorScope** [[8]](#8): Comprises multi-modal environmental data, including temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, obtained from a wireless sensor network deployment. The dataset represents anomalies induced by environmental dynamics and sensor faults.
- **MITDB** [[9]](#9): The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database consists of 48 half-hour two-channel ECG recordings from 47 distinct patients. Unlike the ECG dataset, which stems from a single recording segmented based on periodicity, MITDB includes a heterogeneous patient population with a wide variety of cardiac arrhythmias and noise levels. Its complexity and diversity make it valuable for assessing generalisation across different patients and recording conditions.
- **Daphnet** [[10]](#10): This dataset contains annotated tri-axial accelerometer data from individuals with Parkinson’s disease. Anomalies correspond to freezing-of-gait events during daily walking tasks, representing high-impact anomalies in a clinical setting.
- **IOPS** [[11]](#11): A collection of server-level performance metrics from cloud infrastructure, published as part of the AIOps anomaly detection challenge. The dataset captures subtle performance degradation, transient failures, and high-variance traffic patterns in production environments.
